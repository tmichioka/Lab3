# Create Composites

# Q1: Descrptively, which group has a higher self-esteem? What about life satisfaction? Is the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for males or for females?

Male has a higher self-esteem. Female has a higher life satisfaction.
The relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for
males.

# Visualization of Data Distribution

``` r
lab3data<- lab3data %>%
  drop_na(Gender)


ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = RSE)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_brewer() + theme_modern()
```

# Q2: What you can tell from looking at a violin plot? What you cannot tell? What inferences you can make based on the two violin plots?

A violin plot shows us distribution of scores, range of scores, and
mode.

A violin plot does not tell total number of subjects, correlation
between different variables, median, mean score, standard deviation and
standard error.

According to the violin plot for RSE, we can infer that there is also no
significant self-esteem difference between female and male. However,
self-esteem for males have two modes (3 and 4) while female has only one
mode (3). Overall, self-esteem scores for most males and females have
higher than 2 score.

According to the violin plots for SWL, we can infer that there is also
no significant life satisfaction difference between female and male.
However, there are more females with low satisfaction (i.e., overall
life satisfaction of approximately 10/25) than males and there are more
males with high life satisfaction (i.e., overall life satisfaction of
approximately 20/25) than females.
