```{r}

#Listwise deletion

# Recode Variables: Changing Numeric Values to Characters
```{r}

#Solution 2

#Now recode 2 into Female

#check to see if the recoding was successful

#Now do the same for the other items (5,6,8,9)

# Create Composites
```{r}

#Depending on the scale, sometimes you need to average across the items, other times you might need to sum 


#Fill in the items

#Create another composite for SWL, but this time use rowSums
lab3data <- lab3data %>%
  mutate(SWL = rowSums (cbind(SWL1, SWL2, SWL3, SWL4, SWL5)))

```


# Get Summary Descriptive Statistics
```{r}

lab3data %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(mean_RSE    = mean(RSE),
      mean_SWL    = mean(SWL),
      std_dev_RSE = sd(RSE),
      std_dev_SWL = sd(SWL),

# Q1: Descrptively, which group has a higher self-esteem? What about life satisfaction? Is the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for males or for females? 
Male has a higher self-esteem. Female has a higher life satisfaction. The relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction stronger for males.



# Visualization of Data Distribution
```{r}

lab3data<- lab3data %>%
  drop_na(Gender)


ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = RSE)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_brewer() + theme_modern()

#Create a plot for SWL by Gender with a different color palette

lab3data<- lab3data %>%
  drop_na(Gender)

ggplot(lab3data, aes(x = Gender, y = SWL)) + geom_violin(aes(fill=Gender)) + scale_fill_cosmic () + theme_modern()
```

# Q2: What you can tell from looking at a violin plot? What you cannot tell? What inferences you can make based on the two violin plots? 

A violin plot shows us distribution of scores, range of scores, and mode.

A violin plot does not tell total number of subjects, correlation between different variables, median, mean score, standard deviation and standard error.

According to the violin plot for RSE, we can infer that there is also no significant self-esteem difference between female and male. However, self-esteem for males have two modes (3 and 4) while female has only one mode (3). Overall, self-esteem scores for most males and females have higher than 2 score.

According to the violin plots for SWL, we can infer that there is also no significant life satisfaction difference between female and male. However, there are more females with low satisfaction (i.e., overall life satisfaction of approximately 10/25) than males and there are more males with high life satisfaction (i.e., overall life satisfaction of approximately 20/25) than females.
